- 👋 Hi, I’m @janibanani
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis, especially in spatial related data.
- I am a family guy - reliable, focused, systematic person and always prepared and happy if I can learn something new. 
- What motivates me the most is when people find my work and my knowledge useful.
- I have a knowledge in using different software environements:
-   I'am an Excel user (advanced features such as VLOOKUP, IF statements, PIVOT tables,...)
-   knowing SQL language (mostly SQL Developer for ORACLE database, slowly starting to learn to use PostgreSQL - pgAdmin and DBforge)
-   Basic knowledge and training on databases (database structuring, table relations etc.)
-   knowing R language; R and R studio user:
-       experience in using dplyr, tidyverse, tidyr libraries; 
-       rgdal, raster libraries for dealing with spatial data; 
-       ggplot2 libraries for data presentation
-   GIS software user (advanced ArcGIS user and basic QGIS knowledge)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning power BI and hoping to learn and upgrade my knowlwdge on R and basic knowledge of Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with a company with well defined goals, well defined tasks, good working environment (good vibes) which would find my personal traits, experience and skills useful.
-    I'm looking a company with good options for my personal progress and options to learn new skills.
